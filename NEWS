# Change log

## 0.5.0

-   Processed date and time fields now store their original text values in the
    `"original"` attribute. Partial dates and times are still useful.
-   New functions
    -   `unknown_to_na`: Convert levels of NAACCR factor to `NA` if they mean
        the value is unknown.
    -   `naaccr_encode`: Convert processed values back to their NAACCR text
        codes.
    -   `as.record_format`: Create a custom record format from an object
        (this was incorrectly an internal function before).
    -   `naaccr_date`, `naaccr_datetime`: Parse NAACCR-formatted dates and times.
    -   `read_naaccr_plain`: Read a NAACCR file and divide it into fields, but
        don't do any more processing.
    -   `split_sequence_number`: Divide the different pieces of information in a
        tumor sequence number into multiple columns (i.e., order, uniqueness,
        and invasiveness).
-   Revamped `read_naaccr` and `write_naaccr`
    -   *Much* faster!
    -   `read_naaccr` has more parameters to handle how a file is read:
        `skip`, `nrows`, and `encoding` like in `read.table`, and `buffersize`
        to ease the pain of reading large files.
-   `naaccr_record` and its kin now have a `format` parameter to use custom
    formats.
-   Treat behavior fields as coded factor, as they should've been
-   **Potentially breaking changes**
    -   Cleaning functions (e.g., `clean_count`) no longer use a field name to
        retrieve cleaning parameters (e.g., field width).
        Those parameters now need to passed directly.
    -   The `type` and `alignment` columns of `record_format` objects are now
        factors.
    -   The standard NAACCR record format objects (`naaccr_format_12`, ...)
        are no longer lazy-loaded. They are now immediately loaded.
-   Improved documentation throughout.

## 0.4.0

-   Major improvements to handling of field-specific codes

## 0.3.0

### New features

-   New function: `write_naaccr` for writing `naaccr_record` data sets to text
    files according to one of the NAACCR formats. For now, it writes all unknown
    and missing values as blanks, not the standard codes. Still, `write_naaccr`
    and `read_naaccr` are inverse functions.
-   Fields with country codes are now converted to factors.

### Backend

-   Using package `ISOcodes` instead of `maps` for location code tables
