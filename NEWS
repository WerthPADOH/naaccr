# Change log

## 0.4.0

- Major improvements to handling of field-specific codes

## 0.3.0

### New features

-   New function: `write_naaccr` for writing `naaccr_record` data sets to text
    files according to one of the NAACCR formats. For now, it writes all unknown
    and missing values as blanks, not the standard codes. Still, `write_naaccr`
    and `read_naaccr` are inverse functions.
-   Fields with country codes are now converted to factors.

### Backend

-   Using package `ISOcodes` instead of `maps` for location code tables
